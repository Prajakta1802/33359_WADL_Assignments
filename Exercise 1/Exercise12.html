     <center>   <pre>
Life was always fast-paced, we never slowed down,
Until everything stopped when Corona came to town.

Now all is quiet and there’s peace all around,
We’ve looked in our hearts and kindness we’ve found.

We learn now with mum, this is a new feature,
But we can’t wait to get back to our teacher.

I miss Sea Cadets, school, my friends and my dad,
I miss sharing the fun times and that makes me sad.

We’ve had social distancing picnics, social distancing walks,
Social distancing hugs and social distancing talks.

I’m looking forward to getting away,
The beach, the hotel and a perfect holiday.

When it is? I’ll throw my arms open wide,
And shout to the world, WE CAN ALL GO OUTSIDE!

Don’t give up hope, the end is in sight,
If we all stick together, we’ll all win this fight.
